# What Is GitHub?

Get introduced to GitHub and learn how you can create repositories on the platform.

## A code hosting platform

GitHub is a code hosting platform.

Git creates a local repository on every contributorâ€™s computer, which contains the entire codebase and its revision history.  
 You can **consider GitHub as a platform that stores the whole codebase in a remote repository**.

By enabling the creation of remote repositories, **GitHub allows developers to have a unified source of truth for their source code.**  
 They can treat that as the main version from which every other contributor creates local repositories.

If your codebase is in a remote repository on GitHub:

- Every other contributor who wants to work on the project will know that they can get the code from the remote repository.
- Any updates that they make and then want to share can push those changes to the remote repository instead of sending each contributor the updates one by one.

While Git is a convenient command-line tool that you can utilize to manipulate and update the repository, GitHub serves as an interactive interface where you can navigate through your codebase and the revision history it has gone through effortlessly.

## Creating an account

To create your repositories on GitHub or contribute to other open source projects, you will need to create a personal account on GitHub.

> **Open source projects are those software whose source code is available for free. GitHub has one of the largest communities of open-source projects.**

Once you have your own GitHub account with your unique username and ID, you will be able to contribute to a plethora of public repositories and projects. You will also be able to create your own repositories.
