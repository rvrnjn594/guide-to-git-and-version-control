## Our goal

This course teaches beginners about version control and how to start incorporating Git for solo projects or how to contribute to other collaborative work that rely on version control.

The goal of this course is to make sure you grasp the various concepts of Git and how they can be useful.  
 You do not need to have any prior experience with version control to follow along with this course, but some basic knowledge about terminal commands will be a significant advantage.

## A guide for beginners

This course is a guide for beginners. Therefore, we will begin with the very basics and gradually move on to more complex concepts and terms.  
 Initially, you will learn about version control and what makes Git such a popular tool for version control.

The course will explain how to set up Git configurations on your local machine. You will also learn about GitHub. In addition to providing familiarity with GitHub, this course will also teach you how to create remote repositories (more on this later) and local repositories.  
 By the end of this course, you should have a solid grasp on several important Git concepts such as:

- Commits
- Branches
- Merging
- Rebasing

With that said, letâ€™s proceed forward and take a more detailed look into version control.
